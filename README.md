# EXIF OffsetTime Fixer

This app was built because the DJI Action camera exports the camera time, but not the OffSetTime in the EXIF tags for pictures taken with the camera. This causes your pictures to be all out of order in your gallery apps (like Google Photos), especially on shared albums. ðŸ˜¡

This app loads images in a selected folder that do not have OffsetTime set. Clicking an image will set the OffsetTime, OffsetTimeOriginal, and OffsetTimeDigitized EXIF tags to the current offset of the phone (by default), and saves the image back.

* This app never uploads your pictures anywhere.
* This app will never change an image that already has OffsetTime, OffsetTimeOriginal, or OffSetTimeDigitzed set.

The app is available offline. So when I'm traveling I usually dump my images from my DJI Action 5 Pro to my phone, open the app, fix all the images in the DJI Album, then proceed with either editing, or dump them straight to the photo album.
